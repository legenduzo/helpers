## File names and meanings
Method - The Filenames will be designed to look like oversimplifications sometimes, but then, they follow what has come before. ls and pwd for example in unix-like operating systems.

1. **g** - You can interpret g to mean git. It executes git add ., git commit -m 'message', and git push.\
_Usage Syntax_ g 'commit message'.
